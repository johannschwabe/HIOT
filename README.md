# HomeIOT

The core of my smart home setup.

- **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage  
- **Telegram bot** for real-time notifications and control  
- **REST API** for ingesting data from ESP-based devices and abstracting database interactions  

## Currently Implemented

- 🌱 **Humidity Monitoring**: Tracks soil moisture levels in flower pots to help with plant care

## Future Plans

- 🌬️ **Air Quality Monitoring**: Integrate sensors to monitor CO₂, VOCs, and particulate levels indoors  
- 🤖 **Robot Vacuum Notifications**: Get alerts when the vacuum is stuck or needs water emptied/refilled
